This is the source code listing for the relocation code in 
the PATB ROM file.  The source code was simply compiled 
using DEBUG in DOS.

Note that this code will relocate the PATB from ROM at 
location F600H to RAM memory location 2000H.

ROM location F600H is socket U29 on an IBM PC Motherboard
for the 5150.  Since this is usually the starting location
of CASSETTE BASIC, the Palo Alto Tiny Basic will load
instead.
